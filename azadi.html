                <h3>About Azadi Tower</h3>
                <p>Azadi Tower (Persian: برج آزادی‎, Borj-e Azadi) is one of the tourist attractions in Tehran, Iran. Due to the proximity of this majestic monument to Mehrabad International Airport, many tourists will be getting acquainted with this place as photography upon their arrival. This tower with its stunning architecture is located in the middle of Azadi Square, the main entrance and exit of the city. Every day, many In-city and out-of-city trips are made through it, so it is marked as the western gate of the city. Azadi Tower was designed around 1971 by Hossein Amanat, a young Iranian architect, and was built by Mohammad Pourfathi.</p>
